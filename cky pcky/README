Build a syntatic parser from scartch using CKY Parsing algorithm. 

What is CKY?
Cocke-Younger-Kasami Algorithm (CYK or CKY) is parsing algorithm for context-free grammars. The standard version of CKY operates only on
context-free grammar given in Chomsky Normal form (CNF). It employs buttom-up parsing and Dynamic Programming.

What is PCKY?
Allows to recover the most probable parse given the probablities of the production.


Program Execution: 
  1. python cky.py pcfg.txt sentences.txt -> To execute CKY algorithm.
  2. python cky.py pcfg.txt sentences.txt -prob -> To execute PCKY algorithm.
pcfg.txt or PCFG contains the probabilistic context-free grammar rules in CNF form.
Example of the grmmar file:
S ->NP VP .80
S ->VP NP .20
NP ->I .37
NP ->fish .128
NP ->trust .172
NP ->shrinks .33
VP ->fish .4
VP ->shrinks .3025
VP ->trust .2975


The sentences file contains the sentences that should be parsed.Each sentence will be on separate line.
I fish

Output (CKY):
PARSING SENTENCE: I fish
NUMBER OF PARSES FOUND: 1
TABLE:
cell[1,1]: NP
cell[1,2]: S
cell[2,2]: NP VP


Output (PCKY):
PARSING SENTENCE: I fish
NUMBER OF PARSES FOUND: 1
TABLE:
cell[1,1]: NP(0.3700)
cell[1,2]: S (0.1184)
cell[2,2]: NP(0.1280) VP(0.4000)
